**espfixdep** is a utility designed to optimize the ESP-IDF build process by
refining how source files depend on configuration changes. In a standard build,
the ESP-IDF system generates a generic `sdkconfig.h` file. Because most source
files include this header, changing a single configuration option often
triggers a full project recompilation, even for files unaffected by the change.

The tool acts as a compiler wrapper within the CMake build system. It executes
the original compiler command and checks for the `-MF` flag used to generate
dependency files. If the generated dependency file includes `sdkconfig.h`,
**espfixdep** modifies it by replacing the generic header dependency with
specific dependencies on granular dummy files generated by `esp-idf-kconfig`.

By scanning the source file for specific `CONFIG_*` reference strings,
**espfixdep** ensures that a source file is only marked as "dirty" when one of
its actual configuration dependencies changes. This ensures that after a
configuration update, only the directly affected source files are rebuilt,
reducing incremental build times.
